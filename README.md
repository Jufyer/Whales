# Whales Minecraft Plugin

This Minecraft Plugin adds Whales to Minecraft. With that it also adds Barnacles and also Barnacle Spikes. The Plugin is completly inspired by this Post on [`X`](https://x.com/home) by [`@Vitreous_Glassy`](https://x.com/Vitreous_Glassy). You can find it [`here`](https://x.com/Vitreous_Glassy/status/1675694140368011266).

## Installation

At first you need to install the Plugin like any other Minecraft Plugin. If you are done with that you need to either use the resourcepack by urself or you can set it as a must have on the whole server. You can do that with [`this Tutorial`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCVPgn3IppU) by [`@KasaiSora`](https://www.youtube.com/@KasaiSora) on YouTube.\
You can download the newest release [`here`](https://github.com/Jufyer/Whales/releases).

If you activate it with redstone and a Player is ontop of it, it damages the Player. It looks like this:
